<p>There are 3 doors in front of you. You have to go through one of them. Behind one of the doors, a fire is raging; behind another one, a gunman lurks; behind the last one, there are three lions that haven't eaten in years. Unfortunately, you don't know what's behind any of the doors. Can you survive what's behind the door you choose?
<p>Open a door and seal your fate... or not.</p>

<select id="mySelect" onchange="myFunction()">
 <option>Choose your fate:
 <option value="Door 1">Door 1 <!-- lions -->
 <option value="Door 2">Door 2 <!-- fire -->
 <option value="Door 3">Door 3 <!-- gunman -->
